PRIVACY: " Privacy Policy\n\nArchRobot is designed to help group administrators manage and protect their communities.\n\n Data Access\nI only access publicly available Telegram information such as user ID, username, name, bio, and profile photo. This happens only when a command is used (like /info) or when moderation checks are triggered.\n\n Data Usage\nThis data is used strictly for moderation, security, and administrative purposes, including scam and spam detection. I do not read private messages.\n\n Data Storage\nI do not permanently store personal user data unless required for moderation features. Temporary data used during processing is discarded.\n\n Data Deletion\nYou can request deletion of your stored data at any time by using the /deletedata command.\n\n Data Sharing\nI do not share user data with third parties.\n\nBy using this bot, you agree to Telegram’s own privacy policy."

AHELP: "*Admin*\n\nMake it easy to promote and demote users with the admin module!\n\n*Admin commands:*\n- /promote <reply/username/mention/userid>: Promote a user.\n- /demote <reply/username/mention/userid>: Demote a user.\n- /adminlist: List the admins in the current chat.\n- /admincache: Update the admin cache to reflect new admins or permission changes.\n- /anonadmin <yes/no/on/off>: Allow anonymous admins to use all commands without permission checks. Not recommended.\n- /adminerror <yes/no/on/off>: Send error messages when normal users use admin commands. Default: on.\n\nSometimes, you promote or demote an admin manually and {0} doesn’t realise it immediately. To avoid spamming Telegram servers, admin status is cached locally.\n\nThis means you may need to wait a few minutes for admin rights to update. If you want to refresh them instantly, use /admincache — it will force {0} to recheck admin permissions."
